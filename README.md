# Face-Based-Cursor-Control
Interactive Python application for hands-free cursor control using real-time face and teeth exposure detection.


Cursor movement: the cursor moves to the grid area where a face is detected.

Mouse click: left mouse button is pressed when teeth are exposed and released when the mouth closes.

Start: activates cursor control; Pause: temporarily stops cursor control; Quit: exits the program.

Sensitivity setting: allows users to adjust the threshold for teeth detection, so it can be personalized for comfortable use.
